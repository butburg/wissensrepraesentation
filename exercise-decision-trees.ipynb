    "In this exercise you will train and evaluate a decision tree. Opposed to the previous exercises with the topics _univariate linear regression_, _multivariate linear regression_, _logistic regression_ and _bias variance tradeoff_, you will not implement the algorithms from scratch using numpy. Instead you will use two python packages written on top of numpy, namely the _pandas_ and the _scikit-learn_ package, which are both widely used by the machine learning community. The steps can be broken down into:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the data from a _csv file_ into a pandas DataFrame object\n",
    "2. Preprocess the data\n",
    "3. Train a decision tree and visualize it.\n",
    "4. Do hyperparameter optimization by dividing the dataset into a fixed training set and a fixed validation set.\n",
    "5. Do hyperparameter optimization by crossvalidation\n",
    "6. Do hyperparameter optimization by gridsearch\n",

    "7. The entropy for one node\n",
    "8. The information gain for one node\n",

    "In a decision tree the data is split at each node according to a decision rule. This corresponds to nested *if-then-else*-rules. In the *if*-part of such a rule are decision is made based on a feature of the data record. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the scikit learn implementation. For this implementation the features must be binary or have (at least) ordinal characteristic. If a feature is e.g. nominal with many values, it must be converted to a set of binary (one-hot-coded) features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The splitting rules in the scikit learn implementation are binary and are based on a threshold, e.g.\n",
    "  - _if $x_6 <= 2.14$ then_ left subbranch, *else* right subbranch.         \n",
    "  - binary features must be coded as 0/1, so the rule becomes: if $x_2 <= 0.5$ _then_ left subbranch, _else_ right subbranch. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--The structure of the tree will be determined by data (see below) and a training procedure.-->\n",
    "\n",
    "In the leaves of the tree the (class) predictions are made. There are two possibilities for such an inference: \n",
    "   - hard assignment: Predict for the data records which end up on a leaf by the majority class of the training data that end up on that leaf.          \n",
    "   - soft assignment: Assign probabilities according to the distribution of the classes in respect to the training data which end up on that leaf.\n",

    "\n",
    "A full explanation of the tree will be given later. Here just look at the decision rules (first line of the inner nodes) and at the last line of the leafs. In each leaf you see an array (values) with counts of the different targets for the train data: [number_died, number_survivors] .\n",

    "Finding a tree that splits the training data optimal is [np-hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness). Therefore often a *greedy*-strategy is used:\n",

You employed two popular APIs, scikit-learn and pandas. You also calculated entropy and information gain, measures that are widely applicable in a host of statistics tasks."
